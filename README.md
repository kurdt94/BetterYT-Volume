# BetterYT-Volume 1.0

A Basic Chrome Extension that increases volume on youtube videos. Why ? Youtube normalizes audio to -14 LUFS integrated loudness. And I don't fucking like it !  

- Can I adjust the gain volume ? 
	> To adjust the gain value, set a new value for gain_val in volume.js. setting this value higher than '2.0' may result in distorted / clipped audio.
- Anything I should know ? 
	> The extension only works on youtube.com, not on embeded videos outside of the youtube domain.
- What to do after installing this extension ? 
	> Nothing, Volume gain is applied automatically after installing,  no need to manually activate or use any volume sliders. 
- Why is this extension not in the chrome-store ?
	> Don't have a credit-card, next to not having a credit card. Google is not getting my 5$ !
